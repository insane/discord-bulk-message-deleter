## Installation:

Install Python:
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.3/python-3.7.3-amd64.exe

1. Install Python <3.8 (<b>Make sure you add Python to PATH during installation</b>)
2. Clone the repository to a folder or download as ZIP - make sure to extract
3. Open the terminal in the directory you extracted in and install the required python modules needed to run the program by doing **pip install -r requirements.txt**
4. After the installer closes, put your token in the json file and run **start.bat**
5. You will have 3 prompts to choose from to start deleting!

## DO NOT SHARE THE TOKEN

When you input your token into the josn file, the token will be saved within that file and only that file - do not share the text file as it will give full access to your Discord account!
If you post your token by accident, LOGOUT from discord on that **same browser** you got that token imediately or change your password.
